to undersat what is going on in the picture:
the egress vpc is to filter traffic from inside the vpc to the internet.
the nat


question 2:

a.    An EC2 test machine cannot resolve DNS for internet addresses. What points of failure would you examine?
i will check that the route tables in the test spoke vpc are all configured corrctly
i would check that the transit gateway is forwarding the dns correctly
i will make sure that the test ec2 has correct security groups port 53 for dns and that the checpoint fw ec2 is correct with the security group as well
try nslookup to check if it works correctly
i will check the nat gateway in the egress vpc since it passes there to get outside

b.    The EC2 test machine resolves DNS addresses but fails to communicate with the internet. What could be the source of the issue?
i wil check the security group of the ec2 test to see if it allows https traffic outside
check the transit gateway if it is configured correctly

c.    The EC2 test machine has Docker Engine installed, and its repository is in a VPC (ALM) on a Nexus repository machine. Given the following errors, what would you check?
        Error 1: pull access denied
        Error 2: container pull time out
        Error 3: docker daemon is not running

question 3:

You are exposing a service to the internet based on a DNS record pointing to the EC2 test machine. When accessed externally, the machine's public address is returned, but the service cannot be accessed over HTTPS. What would you examine in the flow?

question 4: 

When attempting to run telnet from the EC2 test machine, an error indicates that the tool is missing. How would you install it on Amazon Linux 2? What could cause a failure in installing it from the repository, and what command would you use to resolve it?
